    "# Scrape Twitter Data for Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, I'm going to scrape any single user's tweets (including retweets) to the Nth scroll refresh.\n",
    "In this particular tutorial, let's scrape CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Require Modules:\n",
    "Scraping twitter can be done in a number of ways.  The quick method I've employed here, just uses beautiful soup to scrape particular parts of the html as it would any webpage.  The complication with this method is that Twitter restricts the base output from such a function to 20 tweets (and even manually scrolling through more and then running the function doesn't seem to add more data nor is it desirable).  So we have to download and install a package called selenium, which will automatically pull up more tweets.  I've read that if you ping twitter too many times that you can get blocked/cause problems for yourself, so I have a 2s pause for each page scroll.  Not sure how important that is or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the required packages to run this code are: selenium, bs4, time, pymongo, numpy, and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to do this (even ones that use the beautifulsoup method), like finding the html page for a time period of tweets that you want and just scraping that.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input Variables:\n",
    "1) Twitter-handle (to be added to base url)\n",
    "2) Number of page scrolls.  Right now, this is hard coded, but can easily be adjusted to be a % of total tweets, etc...\n",
    "\n"
